# gh-bookmarks

This tool helps me import GitHub projects that are important to me into my browser.
This makes it easier to navigate to your projects as bookmarks are considered when
typing into your browser's omnibar (AKA search bar). This eliminates the need to
use GitHub search to get back to somewhere I have already been and consider valuable.
